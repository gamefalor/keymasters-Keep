Feel Free to Ping me about ANYTHING to do with these

Arcaea (AND + IOS)
latest update: 31-12-25
- added Subsphere in Eclosion and Yuno to Arcaea.txt

temporarily removed to see if i can get the codex to update, if you want the implementation ping me about it

remember to use the Arcaea.txt if you wish to not have to test gen every time because it gives the stuff you have to copy paste

use of this is done so that the default yaml CAN be completed by everyone


Bits & Bops (PC)
latest update: 30-12-25
- added infinite games and 7 new options to support them
