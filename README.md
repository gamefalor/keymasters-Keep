Feel Free to Ping me about ANYTHING to do with these

Arcaea (AND + IOS)
latest update: 3-1-26
- more trying and failing to make the codex like me
- did fix some bugs though
- arcaea pack now appears in the default again
temporarily removed to see if i can get the codex to update, if you want the implementation ping me about it

remember to use the Arcaea.txt if you wish to not have to test gen every time because it gives the stuff you have to copy paste

use of this is done so that the default yaml CAN be completed by everyone


Bits & Bops (PC)
latest update: 30-12-25
- added infinite games and 7 new options to support them
