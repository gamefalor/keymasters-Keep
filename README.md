Arcaea (AND + IOS)
latest update: 29-1-26
- added megarex to the implementation
- added OMAJINAI to the txt
- added the new partner to the txt

- removed the playlist trial

remember to use the Arcaea.txt if you wish to not have to test gen every time because it gives the stuff you have to copy paste

use of this is done so that the default yaml CAN be completed by everyone
